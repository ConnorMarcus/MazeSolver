### Test Model
To test the model on Windows run: <code>python maze_classifier.py</code> and on Mac run: <code>python3 maze_classifier.py</code>. Note that if the model file does not exist in directory pytorch_maze_classifier this will not work.
### Run App
To run the actual app GUI on Windows run: <code>python app.py</code> and on Mac run: <code>python3 app.py</code>
